#  Introduction to Jump!

Jump is a simple platformer I created as my highschool capstone project. It uses C#, the Unity game engine and its built-ing physics capabilities to allow the player
to control an object and travese the levels of the game.  
It is entirely designed, coded and and debugged by myself.  
It has varying levels of difficultity to challange your platformer skills.  
  
Once you press play you will see the main menu of of the game.  
Here is where you select the level of difficultity to play in.  
For Beginners it is recommended to start with the easy level as that will help you get used to controllin the ball.

once you inside the level you will have control over the movements of the ball.  
  
Use the A and D key to move left and right accordingly. Use the space bar to make the ball Jump!  
  
You can land on the blue platforms and make you way to the golden platform at the end.  
Once you have touch the golden platform Congraulations! You have completed the level.

 However be careful when moving from a platform to the next.  
 If you happend to miss the platform and fall, THE FLOOR IS LAVA!  
 Once you fall and touch the lava it is game over and you will have to restart from the beginning of the level.
